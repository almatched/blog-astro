Welcome to my _new blog_ about learning Web Dev! Here I will share my learning progress.

## What I've accomplished

1. **Installing Astro**: First, I created a new Astro project.

2. **Making Pages**: I then learned how to make pages by creating new `.astro` files.

3. **Making Blog Posts**: This is my first blog post!

## What's next

I will finish the Astro tutorial.
